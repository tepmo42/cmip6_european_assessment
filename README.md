summary assessment of CMIP6 models for Europe

Models are graded against each of the criteria in the table selection_criteria_cmip6_summary.xls as follows: 

Red : Large widespread errors to the extent that the model is unable to represent the present-day climatology in a useful way and future projections by the model cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way. 
 
Orange: Unsatisfactory, substantial errors in remote regions where downstream effects could be expected to impact on the reliability of regional information and/or present in the local region of interest. 

Yellow: Satisfactory, some substantial errors present but not widespread or not present in the local region of interest. Location of larger remote errors are not known to have a downstream impact in the local region of interest. Captures key characteristics of the criteria spatially or temporarily.

White: : Low errors over both local and remote regions. Captures key characteristics of the criteria spatially or temporarily

Grey: Data/ analysis not available.
